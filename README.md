# Responsive Portfolio with Bootstrap

## Description of the Project

For this project we were tasked with creating a responsive, mobile-first, portfolio using the Bootstrap CSS Framework with three pages; About, Portfolio and Contact. You can learn who I am on the about page, see what I do on the portfolio page and get in touch on the contact page. While there are missing pieces, such as an incomplete representation of my work on the portfolio page and the contact form not working, it is a solid foundation for a future site.
